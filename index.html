<li><b>Supported operating systems:</b>
<p>
I support every operating system. All of them are good in their own rights. Windows provides the most standard user experience. There is a lot of annoying stuff, such as the integrated copilot stuff. I literally have a copilot button on my laptop keyboard. Why are we waisting space on my keyboard for an AI? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying language models are useless, far from it. I'm just saying that there are a lot of programs that are simmilarly "far from useless," Chrome, Sublime Text (or whatever text editor you prefer), Powershell, VLC..... But none of them get their own special button on the keyboard. Why is Microsoft trying to shove copilot down our throats? As an example, I gave it a fair shot just moments ago. I used copilot to help create this very website. It started off good enough. It told me that i need to name this file index.html... And that's where the positives end. After that, I couldn't see any changes on the website, so naturally, the LM tried to convince me that only one file existed in my repository, the ReadMe.md, when there were clearly two. Then it lied about the index.html file being in some ghost folder????? This went on for like 8 minutes of me semi crashing out, when all that was needed was a quick google search to tell me that all i needed to do, was wait like 10 minutes and the website would just update. That is not the end of my complaints with Windows. nr 2. Who ever asked for One Drive????? Like, cool. I get 5 GB of storage for free. nice, no complaints, actually, compliments. But why is it deep rooted in my file explorer? File explorer should be only for files that are actually on my computer, if i want to upload something to the cloud, i can do that easily. Also, why are some files automatically saved to the cloud? Why? Incorporating the cloud does not make for a clear file system. I don't want to rail on Windows too much. It is a good operating system in general, and I understand that most users won't care about my complaints, most will like the copilot stuff. I would just like to have an alternative. A Windows Lite, if you will, without all the bloat, shash like 10 GB from all the useless installations. Now, Mac OS. I have had experience with the Mac operating system. I own a MacBook Air from 2014, and used it until around 2024. It had served me well. I remember coding on it, nothing serious, stuff like the backtracking algorithm you can find on my site. I remember having to use the Terminal app in many cases, and there was never a question of if I should use PowerShell, Terminal, or Command Prompt, and what the difference even is between those, if any. The system felt very fast, like switching between different virtual desktops, or silding up on the touch pad, you know, the apple way. The obvious problem, and the reason I don't want to go back, is that it is simply a less popular system. That results in programs being made for Windows first and foremost, and then maybe Mac. Now using Windows, I feel like I have access to a whole other side of the internet that i simply could not access before. Would I go back if this was solved? I don't know. I've gotten used to Windows now, but I would have to seriously consider it. And lastly, TempleOS. Just kidding. Linux. I haven't had any experience with this OS, aside from trying to get Arch to run on a VM on my 2014 Macbook Air in like 2017 and failing. From what I know, it is open source adjustable by the user to extreme extents. I remember the first time I had to partition a drive was with Arch. Opinion? I really don't know, sounds pretty good, like something I would like. It just kind of sounds like a battle uphill.
